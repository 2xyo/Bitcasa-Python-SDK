Unofficial Bitcasa Python SDK
==================

A quick and dirty Python SDK for Bitcasa. Unofficial, of course.
There is currently a lot of cleaning up and organizing, but I figured I'd share what I have.
I've also included a few examples and as I flesh it out more, I'll provide more documentation. Code should be readable though.
